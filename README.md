# Use

Using Web application: Run npm install in project terminal, then run application with npm start. Go to localhost:3002 and then sign up with a new
account. Once signed up, login with your account. This will bring your to the search page, where samples can be searched up using the search bar. You
can also search for other user’s playlists via the search area in the nav bar. (note: anauthorised users can still search) 
The playlists page is where songs can be added to your own playlists. You can update playlist information on this page (name and description) as well as
delete samples. The profile page has your email and username, and the option to log out.
